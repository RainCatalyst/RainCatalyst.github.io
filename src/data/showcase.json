Then get to the level exit again, now avoiding the clones of your character moving back in time.</i><br>This idea, combined with a slick and precise movement, makes the player consider their every step (or jump) to find different paths through the level.<br><br>The game has received the 9th place (out of nearly 1800 entires) at <a href='https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4/rate/719663' class='link'>Brackeys Jam 2020.2</a>.",
