        Previously, we’ve worked on a variety of projects together with my friend (most of which can be seen in the reel on the background). In addition to our <a href="https://freezedice.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">game jam projects</a>, we have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1819520/Constellations_Puzzles_in_the_Sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">a released game on Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207440/LOK_Digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">a demo for our next title</a>. Recently, we’ve established a 2-person game studio, <a href="https://icedropgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">Icedrop Games</a>.
