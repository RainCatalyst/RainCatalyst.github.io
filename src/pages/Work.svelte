        Hey! I'm a Computer Science student making games and working on personal projects in my free time.
        <br>
        I primarily use <b>Unity and C#</b>, but I also have a fair amount of experience working with <b>C++ (including OpenGL), Lua and HLSL</b>.<br>

        I'm currently employed as a Gameplay Programmer at <a href="https://italicpig.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">Italic Pig</a>, working on our upcoming title <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202200/Paleo_Pines/" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paleo Pines</a>. My main responsibility is implementing gameplay systems, but I also often get involved in tasks outside programming. You can read more about my experience <a href="/paleo" class="link">here</a>.

        Throughout the years participating in game jams I have published <a href="https://freezedice.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">over 15 projects</a> of various scope and made countless prototypes (most of which can be seen in the reel). One of my projects is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1819520/Constellations_Puzzles_in_the_Sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">now released on Steam</a> and another one is coming there soon with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207440/LOK_Digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">playable demo</a> available now.
        <!--Feel free to look at the <a href="/games" class="link">full list of my projects</a> (including some source code).-->
