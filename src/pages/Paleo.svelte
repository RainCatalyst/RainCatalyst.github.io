        I joined the project during its later stages of development, so I had to do various tasks ranging from fixing bugs to implementing new systems on top of the existing ones.
        <br><br>
        Some of my tasks include:<br>
        - Implementing UI, backend and quest systems<br>
        - Working with CSV tables and Scriptable Objects<br>
        - Fixing bugs and improving overall game performance<br>
        <br>
        Our studio encourages everyone to participate in design discussions, so I was glad to have a say. With my previous design experience, I was able to ensure that my code aligned with the design team's vision.
